For SSL authentication, the principal will be derived using the rules defined by ssl.principal.mapping.rules applied on the distinguished name from the client certificate if one is provided; 
otherwise, if client authentication is not required, the principal name will be ANONYMOUS. 

For SASL authentication, the principal will be derived using the rules defined by sasl.kerberos.principal.to.local.rules if GSSAPI is in use, and the SASL authentication ID for other mechanisms. 

For PLAINTEXT, the principal will be ANONYMOUS.
